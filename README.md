# Introduction

Thank you for applying to Preventx as a Frontend Engineer.

To help guage your experience and knowledge as a candidate we require the completion of the test outlined within this project.

# Requirements

The content below outlines any expectations we require for test completion. In addition the `SPECIFICATION.md` file contains
all acceptance criteria relating to this test.

## Tech-Stack

### Minimum

At a minimum we expect the following to be used across the test:

- NPM
- React v18 or v19
- Typescript
- Stylisation tooling of your choice
  - **Examples**: MaterialUI, Tailwind and Bootstrap

### Ideal

Where time and experience permits these would be ideal to include within the project.

- NextJS v14 or v15
- Unit Testing
  - **Examples**: JEST and Vitest

### Bonus

We _do not_ expect these to be embedded within the project but if time and experience permits, please consider including 1 or more of these.

- Automation Testing
  - **Examples**: Playwright and Cypress
- Considerations to user experience when it comes to accessibility
- Localisation/Internationalisation
- If purely React then customisation of the build pipeline

## Test Completion

In addition to the defined tech-stack the following restrictions/requirements MUST be followed:

- You'll have a window of **1 day** to complete as much of the test as possible
- Your test will be run locally so **MUST** be compilable
- You code should be submitted to a GitHub account so we can clone and test the repository
- The `api` directory can be moved to a more appropriate location but the files should not be modified
  - **Note**: There is a dependence on [FakerJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker) so this will need to be included in your `package.json`
- Any icon pack can be utilised (e.g. FontAwesome, React Icons etc) as long as it's installable via NPM
  - **Note**: Icons do not need to exactly match the designs
